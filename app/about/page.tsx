            I am a frontend developer based out of India, who loves to work on
            React and all things JavaScript/TypeScript. I have worked on some
            backend also for my personal projects that used MERN stack .
            <br />
            <br />
            Although I have a degree in computer science from a no tier college,
            I have started coding during the pandemic out of boredom and got
            hooked into it in time . Before getting into coding I was working as
            a manager in a Photogrphy Firm managing clientle and contractual
            photographers .
            <br />
            <br />
            After learning the basics I enrolled myself in a six month bootcamp
            taught by Tanay Pratap and made five fullstack projects within six
            months after learning everything from scratch. I have also wrote
            some blogs on Dev.to and Hashnode which has been read by
            approximately more than 2500 developers yet.
            <br />
            <br />
            After finishing with the bootcamp, I had a chance to work with
            Himanshu Kapoor on this personal crypto project. He is a senior
            software developer in GitLab and a indie hacker who have created a
            lot of games in his spare time.
            <br />
            <br />
            After finishing the crypto project, I got to know that Tanay Pratap
            is looking for a Intern for this startup Invact and without thinking
            twice I jumped on the opportunity of working with him and moved to
            bangalore within two days .
